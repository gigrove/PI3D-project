    //Last thoughts:
    - create a copy of Levelmap and take down the walls
    - instead make some okay shape in the middle and lots of space to walk around it
    - that should also kinda fix the camera clipping enough
    
    - right now the candles light from far away, maybe fix that (I think the Charge range and Light range are the same :< )
    - add the score system
    and then you're okay to go, just write the report
